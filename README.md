## Austin Carrillo

I am currently a Software Engineer at Amazon working on the 'Your Orders' (Order History) team.  On this team I primarily write Java ☕️ code for some of the most visited pages on Amazon worldwide.  In my spare time I like solving coding problems and writing scripts using Python 🐍.  

Prior to becoming a Software Engineer I also worked as a Business Intelligence Engineer where I utilized Python 🐍 & SQL to automate office tasks, generate demand forecasts and create datasets for the AmazonFresh & Prime Now teams.
